## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Process

### TDD Methodology Applied
1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first to define requirements
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor Phase**: Optimize and improve code quality
4. **Repeat**: Continuous iteration for all features

### Test Coverage Highlights
- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for speed and memory usage
- **Edge Case Testing**: Error conditions and boundary scenarios

### Example TDD Cycle
```powershell
# 1. Write failing test
It "Should filter 10K tasks efficiently" {
    $filterTime = Measure-Command {
        $results = $filterEngine.GetFilteredResults()
    }
    $filterTime.TotalMilliseconds | Should -BeLessThan 500
}

# 2. Implement minimal solution
class FilterEngine {
    [array] GetFilteredResults() {
        # Basic implementation
    }
}

# 3. Refactor for performance
class FilterEngine {
    [array] GetFilteredResults() {
        # Optimized with caching, parallel processing, etc.
    }
}
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks Achieved

### Rendering Performance
- **Frame Rate**: Sustained 60 FPS rendering
